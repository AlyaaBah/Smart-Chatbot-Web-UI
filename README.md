# Smart-Chatbot-Web-UI

This project delivers a lightweight, dual-language (English/Arabic) chatbot interface built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend required.

## Objective
To create an interactive web-based chatbot UI where users can send messages and receive smart, scripted replies in a clean, modern interface. The system handles basic natural language matching and displays dynamic conversation flow with support for Arabic and English inputs.

## File Structure
`chatbot.html`  
Single HTML file containing:
- Structured HTML elements for input and chat log  
- Embedded CSS for responsive, aesthetic layout  
- JavaScript logic to interpret user input and generate bot replies

## Interaction Logic
JavaScript scans the user’s input and responds based on keyword matching:
- Supports bilingual responses for greetings, farewells, name inquiries, and expressions of thanks  
- Auto-scrolls to the latest message  
- Sends the message using the Enter key

## How It Works
1. User opens `chatbot.html` in any modern browser.  
2. Types a message in either English or Arabic and presses Enter.  
3. The bot returns a predefined response based on detected phrases.  
4. Chat history is displayed in scrollable format.

## Features
- Sleek, minimalistic design with modern UI elements  
- Supports English/Arabic input dynamically  
- Interactive replies using keyword detection  
- No external dependencies or server setup required  
- Lightweight and ideal for embedding in broader projects
